### Todo:
- Establish a method for allowing relevant individuals to register
and view the progress of the people under their jurisdiction
- Give users personal identity questions to be used during registration
as well as throughout the course to verify their identities
- Establish method for viewing the quizzes and course progress
of the students.

### Questions:
- Logo and branding?
- What do you mean by built-in timer controls?
- How should the security questions work? How many of them should there be?
How often should they pop up? At what intervals should they pop up to
verify identity without potentially compromising data that hasn't been
saved on the page? What is the purpose of these?
- As far as audio is concerned, will each course have narrated audio files
that you'll want to upload yourself, or do you want a digital reader
that can automatically read the text inside of a lesson?
- What do you want the process to look like for relevant individuals (employers,
probation officers, etc.) to request an account to monitor a student?
